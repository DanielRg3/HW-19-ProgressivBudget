# HomeWork 19 "Online/Offline Budget Trackers"

## Project Description
In this project, we need to add functionality to a Budget Tracker application in order to allow the user to use the app even when they are offline.

The user must be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or wothout a connection.
It is expected that, when entering transactions offline, the app should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:
- Enter deposits.
- Enter expenses.

When brought back online:
- Offline entries should be added to the tracker.
